# GraphQL Job Board

This project was started with a copy of a project used in the [GraphQL by Example](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-by-example/?referralCode=7ACEB04674F000BAC061) course.

It uses Apollo Server with Express, and graphql-request or Apollo Client as the GraphQL client. The application is used to explain queries, mutations, custom object types, authentication, etc.
